I chose to refine the marks and channels theme as one of my refinements.

While taking this course, I learned that different types of data can be represented through different marks and channels. By reading the marks and channels chapter and attending the course lecture, I learned the importance of choosing the best mark (line, point, etc) to address a user task. The Dear Data refinement stood out to me because I could creatively showcase the effectiveness of mark and channel choices without being limited to the few idioms this course has covered. I could create my own idiom! I also liked that the data I was representing would be data from my own life, not a static dataset found on Kaggle. I enjoyed creating the D-hall visualization the most because of the glyphs I made, combining satisfaction and meal type.

</div>

By completing this Dear Data activity, I learned that there are only so many marks and channels that can represent magnitude, categorical data, and position so, it is important for visualization designers to have a narrow user task scope. Crowding the visualization space with too many marks or having a glyph represent too many attributes will confuse the user. This activity also emphasized the design choice to have hue represent categorical attributes. When designing the D-hall dinner visualization, I asked my friends what hues they wanted to represent them. They loved the intentionality behind the question, and it emphasized how design choices can have connotations to them.

    <figcaption>Dear Data card encoding my mom's Mother's Day pickleball win! (I suck at pickleball). This visualization uses hue to encode me and mom and mangnitude to encode wins.</figcaption>
</figure>

Outside of class, I will apply these concepts to my work when developing visualizations. The top concepts I will apply relate to encoding choices. The Dear Data activity made me think about what I wanted my users to ascertain from my visualization. I limited my task numbers to three tasks per visualization because I knew my glyphs could only represent so many attributes, and I only had so much space on my index card. Before I created my visualizations, I outlined the data types of my attributes and explored the best ways to represent them.
