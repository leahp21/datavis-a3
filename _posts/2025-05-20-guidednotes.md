One of the curations I decided to include was the guided notes course item.

I chose this item to include in my portfolio because the guided note worksheets were vital to fully grasping course material. Considering roughly half of this semester included regular reading quizzes, I could not discuss what I learned in this course without discussing reading comprehension aids like guided notes. Before utilizing the guided notes for each chapter, I struggled with remembering data viz terminology prior to reading quizzes. With chapters packed with new terms, there were plenty of times when I wasn't sure of each chapter's key takeaways. The guided notes helped me take note of main themes within chapters and helped me identify connections in one chapter to content in another. 

I was surprised that the more I used guided notes, the more likely I was to successfully anticipate 
key concepts without directly looking at my notes. When I started using guided notes, I was sometimes surprised to see a note question about what I perceived as a minor concept. By the third guided note, I developed the habit of constantly questioning course material as I read. By the fourth guided note, I was able to fill out *most* guided note questions by referencing my *own* notes, reinforcing my confidence while taking this course.

Outside of class, I plan to continue applying active learning strategies when I am approaching dense texts. Particularly, the ability to develop questions about literature concepts while reading, rather than after reading, will be applied to my work in industry.
